## What this project does.

This project was made to fulfill my want to be able to place windows on my desktop in a 4 square like fashion with a keybind. After creating keybinds for these scripts you will be able to place windows in the following ways:

*	Top horizontally maximized
*	Bottom horizontally maximized
*	Left vertically maximized
*	Right vertically maximized
*	Left Top half width and height
*	Left bottom half width and height
*	Right Top half width and height
*	Right Bottom half width and height

## Prerequisites

In order for these scripts to work you must first install *wmctrl*.

I installed *wmctrl* in Ubuntu by running `sudo apt-get install wmctrl` in terminal.

## Installation

To install clone the project and copy the scripts located in the *bin\* dir to a dir accessible in your *PATH*. Now create keyboard shortcuts that execute the scripts.
